## Ai & Cns

Are we going to release AIs' everywhere in the soon future?

I am fan of AI and we all interested in it, but we can. use it everywhere or any time, because AI is not worth it. Limited AI maybe such as Siri on our iPhones, but cannot depend on AI anytime sooner or later.

I admiring new and exploring new science, and really interesting since I have read about it which is **computational neuroscience**, you can read more about it on [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience).

A very impressive science and I have read a lot of it and really wanna become a specialist within Computational Neuroscience, I spent a whole year reading and searching and video watching on YouTube and other platforms about neuroscience.

I do not want to create a limitless AI, I wanna help the world to understand how dangerous is AI.
